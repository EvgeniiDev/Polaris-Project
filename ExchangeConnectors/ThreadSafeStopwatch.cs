/// This class enables AppDomain-wide profiling of multi-threaded

/// threads. If multiple threads start the same watch in parallel,
/// this class ensures that we count time for both threads, and that
/// they do not interfere with each other. It does this by storing an
/// internal stop-watch in TLS, and an instance-wide tick counter.
///
/// Note that the cumulative count is only ever incremented if a
/// thread actually calls Stop in its own stop-watch. If a thread
/// routine terminates w/out stopping the watch, it's as if it never
/// began.
